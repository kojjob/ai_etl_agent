## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Vision Statement
The Rails AI ETL Agent is a revolutionary AI-powered platform designed to democratize data-driven decision-making for small businesses. It transforms complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes into intuitive, conversational interactions, enabling non-technical users to extract meaningful insights from their business data without requiring specialized expertise.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- **Primary**: Small businesses (1-25 employees, $50K-$1M revenue)
- **Users**: Business owners, marketing managers, sales managers, customer support leads, finance personnel
- **Technical Skill Level**: Low to none - users understand their business but not SQL, Python, or complex BI tools

### 1.3 Core Value Proposition
- **Zero-Setup Data Science**: Advanced analytical capabilities without technical expertise
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interactions for data queries and transformations
- **Proactive AI Partner**: Goes beyond reactive queries to suggest valuable insights and actions
- **Consolidated Business View**: Brings scattered data sources into one accessible platform
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Professional authentication system with clean, corporate-appropriate interfaces

### 1.4 Problem Solved
**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Data silos across disconnected business applications
