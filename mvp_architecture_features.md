# Portable ETL AI Agent MVP: Minimal Architecture and Features

## 1. Architecture Overview

The portable ETL AI agent MVP will follow a monolithic architecture with modular components to maximize simplicity while maintaining flexibility. This approach reduces deployment complexity and dependencies while allowing for future expansion.

### 1.1 Core Components

- **ETL Core Engine**: Central component that coordinates the entire ETL process
- **Data Connector Module**: Handles connections to supported data sources
- **Transformation Module**: Processes data with configurable rules and simple AI capabilities
- **Storage Module**: Manages data persistence and retrieval
- **Visualization Module**: Provides basic reporting and insights display
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles user settings and job definitions

### 1.2 Data Flow

1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from CSV files or QuickBooks via the Data Connector Module
2. **Staging**: Raw data is temporarily stored in a local staging area
3. **Transformation**: Data is processed according to predefined rules and simple AI models
4. **Loading**: Transformed data is stored in a local database
5. **Visualization**: Results are presented through basic dashboards and reports

### 1.3 Deployment Model

- **Single Process Deployment**: All components run within a single process to minimize complexity
- **Configuration-Based Setup**: System behavior defined through configuration files rather than code
- **Embedded Database**: Self-contained database to eliminate external dependencies
- **Portable Runtime**: Packaged with necessary runtime components to run across environments

## 2. MVP Feature Set

### 2.1 Data Source Support

- **CSV File Import**: Support for local and remote CSV files with automatic schema detection
- **QuickBooks Integration**: Basic integration with QuickBooks using their API
- **Manual Data Entry**: Simple forms for manual data input when needed
- **Data Export**: Export capabilities to CSV and Excel formats

### 2.2 Transformation Capabilities

- **Data Cleaning**: Basic cleaning operations (deduplication, missing value handling)
- **Data Type Conversion**: Automatic and user-defined type conversions
- **Aggregations**: Simple aggregation functions (sum, average, count, etc.)
- **Filtering**: Condition-based data filtering
- **Joining**: Simple joining of datasets based on common fields

### 2.3 AI Capabilities

- **Anomaly Detection**: Basic statistical anomaly detection for numerical data
- **Simple Forecasting**: Time-series forecasting using lightweight algorithms
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of basic patterns in business data
- **Automated Data Profiling**: Statistical profiling of datasets

### 2.4 Visualization and Reporting

- **Basic Dashboards**: Pre-configured dashboards for common business metrics
- **Standard Reports**: Template-based reports for sales, inventory, and customer data
- **Data Export**: Export of visualizations and reports to common formats
- **Interactive Filters**: Simple filtering and drill-down capabilities

### 2.5 User Interface

- **Web-Based Interface**: Lightweight web interface accessible via browser
- **Command-Line Interface**: For automation and headless operation
- **Configuration Editor**: Visual editor for ETL job configuration
- **Job Scheduler**: Simple scheduling of recurring ETL tasks

## 3. Technical Constraints

### 3.1 Performance Constraints

- **Memory Usage**: Maximum 2GB RAM consumption
- **CPU Usage**: Designed to run effectively on dual-core processors
- **Storage Requirements**: Minimal disk footprint (<500MB for application, excluding data)
- **Concurrency**: Support for sequential job execution (no parallel processing in MVP)

### 3.2 Operational Constraints

- **Offline Operation**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Installation**: Single-step installation process
- **Updates**: Simple, non-disruptive update mechanism
- **Backup/Restore**: Built-in backup and restore functionality

## 4. Extension Points

While maintaining simplicity, the MVP will include defined extension points for future enhancements:

- **Data Source Adapters**: Interface for adding new data source connectors
- **Transformation Rules**: Framework for adding custom transformation logic
- **AI Models**: Pluggable architecture for more sophisticated AI capabilities
- **Visualization Templates**: System for adding custom report templates
- **Authentication Providers**: Hooks for integrating with authentication systems

## 5. Out of Scope for MVP

To maintain focus and simplicity, the following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

- **Real-time data processing**: Only batch processing will be supported
- **Advanced machine learning**: Complex ML models requiring significant resources
- **Multi-user collaboration**: Single-user focus for the MVP
- **High-volume data processing**: Optimized for small business data volumes
- **Custom coding interfaces**: Configuration-based approach only
- **External BI tool integration**: Self-contained reporting only
